%% multi-channel version, requested by BCJM in April 2015: 1, 3, 5, 8, 12, 16, and 22 channels
% % try to make NChans selectable from program.
% % 1 Nov 2012: updated version to handle long attack times in SLOW compression M.A.Stone, Auditory Perception Group.
% % (1) put limiter in each channel after compressor stage (attack time & CRlim not available via GUI)
% % (2) print out %-age of activity of limiter (post [recalculate])
% % (3) extend range of frequencies for which IG can be specified (now down to 125 Hz, but subject to implementation via FIR)
% % Changes have occurred to [aid_sim, aid_panel.fig, recalculate, Nchan_FbankAid, dualchannel_AGC]
% % Small change to [prescription_design_function.m] so as to extend plotting area
% % DOS-box window
