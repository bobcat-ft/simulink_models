% openMHA Dynamic Compression Simulink Model Code
% Gain Application Controller Test/Verification Simulation Stop Script
% 11/18/2020

%% NOTES

% The following script is designed to isolate and test the Gain Application
% Controller simulation results against expected results. Note that these
% results will not be derived directly from openMHA source code, as the
% gain application controller exists due to the time-division multiplexing
% resulting from the data flow architecture in the Simulink model.
